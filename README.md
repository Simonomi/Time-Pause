# Time pause
A minecraft datapack to pause time

### How to use:
Just copy the entire repository folder to the _.minecraft/saves/**worldname**/datapacks_ folder. In the world, type _/reload_ to reload the datapacks, and the datapack should run. To get a Time stopper, just throw a nether star and a clock down on the same spot. Merely put the clock into your off-hand to toggle stopping time
